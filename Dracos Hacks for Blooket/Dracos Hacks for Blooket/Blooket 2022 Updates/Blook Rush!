Because we are just a couple of weeks into the New
Year and it’s about time we have a new mode!
So, Blook Rush arrives today for all Plus
members! This mode was designed to be
played with teams where students answer
questions to protect their Blooks or attack
other teams and take theirs!

This mode is fast-paced and is sure to reward
teams that can both answer questions quickly
and strategize together! We hope you enjoy
the mode, and it’ll be free for everyone to try
on February 3rd!
