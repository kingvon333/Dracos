If you're thinking, "How many boxes do I have to open to get ___ ?", read this. Let's use the Mega Bot as
an example. With this we need to take into account that each box you open, the
drop rate will stay the same. e.g 0.3%
You're probably thinking that if you open >333 boxes you'd be guaranteed to get it. Well, you're wrong. The
drop rate is 0.3% per box. Now let's do some simple math (example):

You open the bot box 2 times.
The drop rate is 0.3%
The chance of Not getting it is 99.7%
99.7 = 0.997
0.997 ^ T = 0.994009 (T = boxes opened, so 2)
For one or the other (or both) the chance of you not getting it is 99.4009%
100 - 99.4009 = 0.5991
This means that for one or the other, the chance of getting it would be 0.5991%


That should help.
