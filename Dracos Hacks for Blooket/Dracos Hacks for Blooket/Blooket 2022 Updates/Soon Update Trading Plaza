Not yet a feature for Blooket.
it may be added eventually because it said "not yet" during the April Fools Day Update
. When you click on Trading Plaza it says "Just Kidding! Not Yet...", meaning it might come in a later update.
You click on 'Boo...' to exit the pop-up. Ben has also said in the past that he will add trading, but he has other stuff he wants to work on first.

:NOTE:
If u dont know BEN
BEN MADE Blooket
