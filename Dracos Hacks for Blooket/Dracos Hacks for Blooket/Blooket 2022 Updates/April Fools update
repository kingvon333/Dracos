APRIL FOOLS



On April 1st Of 2021, the following changes were made to Blooket:

The News Feed said everything is fine. However, the characters are reversed, meaning "everything is not fine"
Blooks in the blook list were upside down.
Blooks in Factory were upside down.
Blooks in Tower of Doom were upside down.
Blooks in the Market were upside down.


However, strangely, the blooks in Tower Defense were not altered in any way at all unlike the other game mode changes.

The same update of 2021 is in 2022's april fools update,
but with 1 difference, a ¨Trading Plaza¨. Once interacted, it will say "Just Kidding! Not yet..." you can close the pop up by clicking "Boo..."
